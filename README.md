# SQL project: food delivery service

In this SQL project, I used synthetic data provided for the "SQL Simulator" course from [Karpov.courses](https://karpov.courses/). I conducted an exploratory analysis using both basic and advanced SQL queries. 
The data includes users' actions, their orders, and couriers' actions from 24/08/22 to 08/09/22.

In this project, I calculated product metrics for a food delivery service, such as:

1. **Product Economics:**
   - Calculation of revenue indicators
   - ARPU (Average Revenue Per User), ARPPU (Average Revenue Per Paying User), and AOV (Average Order Value)
   - Cumulative ARPU, ARPPU, and AOV
   - ARPU, ARPPU, and AOV by day of the week
   - Daily revenue distribution between new and returning users
   - Analytics for products that generate the most income
   - Calculation of costs with taxes and gross profit

2. **Marketing Metrics:**
   - DAU (Daily Active Users), MAU (Monthly Active Users)
   - CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)
   - ROI (Return on Investment)
   - Average bill for campaigns
   - Retention rate by days
   - Retention rate by cohorts
   - Cumulative ARPPU by cohorts and days
