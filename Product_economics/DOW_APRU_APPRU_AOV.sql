-- Calculation of metrics:
-- Revenue per user (ARPU).
-- Revenue per paying user (ARPPU).
-- Revenue per order (AOV).
-- In our calculations, we will only consider data from August 26, 2022, to September 8, 2022, inclusiveâ€”ensuring the analysis includes an equal number of all weekdays (exactly two days each).
-- The resulting table will include both the names of the days of the week (e.g., Monday) and the ordinal number of the day of the week (from 1 to 7, where 1 is Monday and 7 is Sunday).
